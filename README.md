# CS50 Project - Unit Converter

## Introduction  
This project is my very first submission for the Harvard CS50 course. The purpose of this project is to build a simple yet functional web application that converts units from one measurement system to another. This project helped me understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as how to make interactive web pages.

The unit converter supports multiple types of conversions such as length (meters to feet and vice versa), weight (kilograms to pounds and vice versa), and volume (liters to gallons and vice versa). The goal was to create a user-friendly interface that anyone can use without any prior technical knowledge.

## How to Run the Project  
To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari. No additional setup or installation is required. Just double-click the file or right-click and choose “Open with” and select your preferred browser.

The project runs completely on the client side, meaning all the processing happens inside the browser without needing an internet connection or server backend. This makes the project easy to deploy and use on any device.

## Requirements  
There are no special software requirements for this project other than having a modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The code is designed to be compatible with most current browsers.

You do not need any programming tools or libraries installed to use this unit converter. It is purely built using standard web technologies.

## Usage Instructions  
Once the page is loaded, you will see input fields for different units of measurement. Simply enter a number in the input box corresponding to the unit you want to convert. The result will automatically update in the output field next to it.

For example, if you want to convert meters to feet, enter the number of meters in the input box, and the equivalent value in feet will appear automatically.

This makes it easy to quickly convert between units without needing to do manual calculations or look up conversion factors.

## Project Features
